        Stages:
        ◦ Checkout: Pulls the code from a Git repository (main branch).
        ◦ Run Scans in Parallel:
            ▪ Static code analysis.
            ▪ Security scans.
        ◦ Code Stability: Verifies code robustness.
        ◦ Code Quality Analysis: Assesses code quality metrics.
        ◦ Code Coverage Analysis: Checks the test coverage of the codebase.
        ◦ Generate Reports: Prepares reports based on the analyses.
        ◦ Approval for Publish: Waits for a manual approval step before proceeding to publishing.
        ◦ Publish Artifacts: Publishes the build artifacts to a specified location or repository.
       2. Parallel Execution:
        ◦ Scans (Static code analysis and security scans) are executed in parallel to save time.
       3. Post-Execution Steps:
        ◦ Always: Cleanup tasks after the pipeline's execution.
        ◦ Success: Message indicating successful pipeline completion.
        ◦ Failure: Message indicating pipeline failure.
